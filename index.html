          <p>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</p>
          Quite honestly, we can’t think of one<br><br><br>

            At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing its magnificence up close.
            <br><br><br>
            After all, this is art. Built in Agra, India between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br><br>
            Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…</p>
            <h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal </h2>
            <p>
                That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br><br>
                Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.
                <br><br>
                To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours (now with solo-only departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India and Nepal.
               <br><br>
               If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mumbai!

                The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you're mentally prepared, you will be fine. What's to come is more than worth the wait
                ...<br><br>
                <h3>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3>
                Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.
                <br><br>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:  </p>
            <div>
                <nav>
                    <li>Passport</li>
                    <li>Money</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Medicine</li>
                    <li>Camera</li>
                    <li>Phone</li>

                </nav>
            </div>
            <h3>What to wear to the Taj Mahal </h3>
            <p>
                There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.
                <br><br>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear sunscreen.
                 Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br><br>
                 If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the worst of the heat.<br><br>

                Useful tip from Ryan Turner,Intrprud's Destination Manager From India<br><br>
                Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of laces are hard!
                <h3>Other things you need to know </h3>
                No food is allowed inside.<br><br>
                Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.
               <br><br> Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small video cameras) are not allowed.
                <br><br>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your wits about you and you won’t need to worry!

    <h4>When you’re at the Taj Mahal </h4>
    <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if possible).

   <br><br> And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly (or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has some tips on how to do this:
    <h4>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal </h4>
    <br><br>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.
